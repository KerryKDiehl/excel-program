excel-program
=============
This is my first ever, real life program.  I created it while working as a financial analyst and am confident that it saved me and others a solid 20 hours of work/month.  The code is scrappy since I was learning everything as I went along but it did the job quickly and efficiently and printed out a nice looking summary for the higher-ups.  This program is the main reason that I decided to learn to code.
